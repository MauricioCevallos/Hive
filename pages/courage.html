    <p>You will need lots of courage, yes. The outside world is no joke. It is ruthless, you could get lost! The world goes on forever, no bee has ever explored all of it. Not only that but there are also several predators that want nothing more but to consume you making you useless to the queen and the hive. So be careful.</p>
